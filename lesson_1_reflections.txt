Version Control:
Git is a version control system
Github a collaboration platform

Windows -Y compare files with "FC"

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing different versions of files helps me to spot errors more easily, since
one does not need to check the whole code base for errors but only the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I would spend less time looking for mistakes and could easily try different things
with a working basic version

Commits are the basic checkpoints of Git

Using git to see history

One Commit per Logical Change Solution

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The advantage of manual saving is that saves can be done at logical points so that
versions can be compared more easily
The disadvantage is that one could simply forget so save the files

Commits with multiple Files: Repository

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
When coding, saving files that belong together is important for the functionality
of the program one is writing

Git clone lets you duplicate whole repositories to your own pc

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log enables me to see all the commits of a repository.
Git diff can show me changes between two specific commits

Checking out old versions of code: Git log, then git checkout with appropriate id


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It would give me the courage to try stuff, because I could always go back to the old version


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it to be more efficient, find bugs easier and be able to cooperate
with other coders
