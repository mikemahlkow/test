Git if you work alone:
Files that start with period are generally hidden from the user

Initializing a repository: git init

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new repository gets created that creates a hidden folder in which previous commits
are stored without the user being able to see them. You need to do it in order
to be able to use Git properly

Files are in the working directory at first, not in git repository.

Working directory -> staging area -> Git repository
git status shows us what is in the staging area, working directory and git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is only a storage opportunity. It allows logical changes of the overall programm to be made.
If every file that is added would lead to a commit immediately it would not be possible to do this
